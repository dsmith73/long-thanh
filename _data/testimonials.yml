  testimonial: "David Vu named the restaurant he owns and cooks for after his hometown in south Vietnam, and his commitment into serving authentic flavors has consistently earned five stars from his customers. Of course, they’ll have your giant bowls of pho, but don’t miss out on the dishes served sizzling hot in a clay pot. If you’re a heavy fish eater, you’ll appreciate the whole fried option, which you can slide easily off the bone with a squeeze of lime."

  testimonial: "I went to Long Thanh at the recommendation of the owner of the nail salon I use when I asked about where to try pho. She did not steer me wrong! The first couple of times I went there I got my order to go. Because my boyfriend was out of town. They packed up all the components separately so the noodles were still perfect when I got home. My boyfriend and I have also eaten in the restaurant a couple of times since, and I find myself wanting to go cack for more."
