  testimonial: "David Vu named the restaurant he owns and cooks for after his hometown in south Vietnam, and his commitment into serving authentic flavors has consistently earned five stars from his customers. Of course, they’ll have your giant bowls of pho, but don’t miss out on the dishes served sizzling hot in a clay pot. If you’re a heavy fish eater, you’ll appreciate the whole fried option, which you can slide easily off the bone with a squeeze of lime."

  testimonial: "I’ve eaten at several Vietnamese restaurants around town, and I have to say this is probably one of the best. Order number 52. It comes in a bowl with chicken, and it’s delicious."
