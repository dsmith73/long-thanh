## About:  

Hi, my name is David Vu. I am the owner and chef of Long Thanh restaurant.

>Long Thanh is a southern city in Vietnam where I use to live. I opened my Restaurant in July of 1997. My culinary cuisine has variations of Chinese and Vietnamese food. Come stop by and try my famous curry clay pot with your choice of meat, or try our delicious Pho, which is a famous Vietnamese soup (you can pick your choice of meat) that comes with sweet basil, cilantro, noodles, peppers, bean sprouts, and our homemade broth, which you will love.
